abstract = {It is common sense that cloud-native applications (CNA) are intentionally designed for the cloud. Although this understanding can be broadly used it does not guide and explain what a cloud-native application exactly is. The term “cloud-native” was used quite frequently in birthday times of cloud computing (2006) which seems somehow obvious nowadays. But the term disappeared almost completely. Suddenly and in the last years the term is used again more and more frequently and shows increasing momentum. This paper summarizes the outcomes of a systematic mapping study analyzing research papers covering “cloud-native” topics, research questions and engineering methodologies. We summarize research focuses and trends dealing with cloud-native application engineering approaches. Furthermore, we provide a definition for the term “cloud-native application” which takes all findings, insights of analyzed publications and already existing and well-defined terminology into account.}

Hardware vendors have introduced a variety of hardware-assisted trusted execution environments including ARM TrustZone, Intel Management Engine, and AMD Platform Security Processor. Recently, Intel Software Guard eXtensions (SGX) and AMD Memory Encryption Technology have been introduced. To the best of our knowledge, this paper presents the first comparison study between Intel SGX and AMD Memory Encryption Technology in terms of functionality, use scenarios, security, and performance implications. We summarize the pros and cons of these two approaches in comparison to each other.},

ABSTRACT={A lack of trust in the providers is still a major barrier to cloud computing adoption – especially when sensitive data is involved. While current privacy-enhancing technologies, such as homomorphic encryption, can increase security, they come with a considerable performance overhead. As an alternative Trusted Executing Environment (TEE) provides trust guarantees for code execution in the cloud similar to transport layer security for data transport or advanced encryption standard algorithms for data storage. Cloud infrastructure providers like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft introduced TEEs as part of their infrastructure offerings. This review will shed light on the different technological options of TEEs, as well as give insight into organizational issues regarding their usage.}

abstract = {Software developers face a number of challenges when creating applications that attempt to keep important data confidential. Even with diligent attention paid to correct software design and implementation practices, secrets can still be exposed through a single flaw in any of the privileged code on the platform, code which may have been written by thousands of developers from hundreds of organizations throughout the world. Intel is developing innovative security technology which provides the ability for software developers to maintain control of the security of sensitive code and data by creating trusted domains within applications to protect critical information during execution and at rest. This paper will describe how this technology has been effectively used in lab exercises to protect private information in applications including enterprise rights management, video chat, trusted financial transactions, and others. Examples will include both protection of local processing and the establishment of secure communication with cloud services. It will illustrate useful software design patterns that can be followed to create many additional types of trusted software solutions.},
